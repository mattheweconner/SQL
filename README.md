Welcome to my SQL portfolio, where I showcase practical examples of data analysis using real-world datasets. Each project highlights my ability to write clean, efficient queries to extract insights, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making. This repository is intended to give recruiters and hiring managers a clear view of my SQL skills and analytical thinking as I pursue opportunities in data analysis.
